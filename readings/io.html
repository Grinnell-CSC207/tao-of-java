In the early days of computing, programs were run only in <span class="emphasis"><em>batch</em></span> mode.  That is, you would start the program, wait for it to compute results (or crash), and then read the results (or error log).  Initially, programmers coded any values the program would use directly into the program.  Soon thereafter, however, they realized that it was far more general to place the input to a program (and the output from a program) in separate files.  
</p><p>
With the advent of interactive computing systems, it became even more
important for programs to be able to read input from a variety of sources and to send output to a variety of targets.  In early interactive systems, most input was based on text that came from the keyboard and that went to a monitor or printer that showed only alphanumeric characters.  Hence, the focus of early input and output commands was textual input and output.
</p><p>
Event with the creation of modern window-based systems, in which input can come from mice, touchscreens, and a variety of other devices and output can be graphical and auditory as well as textual, it is still useful to be able to read and write text, if only to save comments to a log and to gather data from a file.  
</p><p>
In many of the exercises in <span class="emphasis"><em>Espresso</em></span>, we will focus on text-based
input and output.  It is therefore important to learn textual
input and output.  In this reading (and the corresponding lab), we will
explore the basics of textual input and output.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional">Output Basics</h2></div></div></div><p>
You should already know most of what you need to know about simple output
in Java.  The primary kind of object for output (at least the most basic
output) is a <code class="code">java.io.PrintWriter</code>.  You can create PrintWriters
that print to the screen and PrintWriters that print to a file.
</p><p>
To create a PrintWriter for the sceen, use something the following.
<code class="code">
java.io.PrintWriter pen;
pen = new java.io.PrintWriter(System.out, true);
</code>
</p><p>
Two shorthands can simplify this code.  First, if you import <code class="code">java.io.PrintWriter</code>, you need only provide the basic class name.  Second, you can put assignment on the same line as declaration.  The result is therefore
<code class="code">
PrintWriter pen = new PrintWriter(System.out, true);
</code>
</p><p>
Preparing a PrintWriter for a file is nearly as simple.  First, you must create an object in class <code class="code">java.io.File</code>.  Second, you build a new <code class="code">PrintWriter</code> with that file as a parameters.  In verbose form,
<code class="code">
java.io.File outfile;
java.io.PrintWriter pen;
outfile = new java.io.File("<span class="emphasis"><em>name-of-file</em></span>");
pen = new java.io.PrintWriter(outfile);
</code>
</p><p>
Custom suggests that you <code class="code">close</code> a File when you're done with it.
</p><p>
<code class="code">
pen.close();
</code>
</p><p>
One benefit of creating the same kind of object for either kind of output
is that it's very easy to update your program to write to a file instead
of to the screen (or vice versa).
</p><p>
PrintWriters provide a few basic methods:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><code class="code">print(<span class="emphasis"><em>what-to-print</em></span>)</code>: Queue for printing the given value to the appropriate destination.  Does not print a carriage return, so subsequent output will appear on the same line.</li><li><code class="code">println(<span class="emphasis"><em>what-to-print</em></span>)</code>: Print the given value to the appropriate destination followed by a carriage return.  Normally &#8220;<span class="quote">flushes</span>&#8221; the output.</li><li><code class="code">println()</code>: Print a carriage return.  Normally &#8220;<span class="quote">flushes</span>&#8221; the output.</li><li><code class="code">flush()</code>: Finishes printing anything queued by <code class="code">print</code>.</li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Many programmers find the delayed printing of <code class="code">print</code>
somewhat confusing.  After all, you've told the PrintWriter to print,
so why doesn't it do so immediately?  It turns out that for some
applications, it is much more efficient to delay printing until a
certain amount of text has been printed.  The designers of Java, like
many designers before them, decided to make &#8220;<span class="quote">wait until there's enough
to write</span>&#8221; the default behavior and provided <code class="code">flush</code>
for those who want different behavior.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional">Input Basics</h2></div></div></div><p>
Most simple input in Java is done using objects from class
<code class="code">java.io.BufferedReader</code>.  As you might expect,
you can create buffered readers that read from the keyboard and
buffered readers that read from files.  However, before creating
a BufferedReader, 
you must create an intermediate object, either an
<code class="code">java.io.InputStreamReader</code> or a
<code class="code">java.io.FileReader</code>.  
</p><p>
For example, to create an object to read from the keyboard, you would use code like the following
<code class="code">
java.io.BufferedReader eyes;
java.io.InputStreamReader istream;
istream = new java.io.InputStreamReader(System.in);
eyes = new java.io.BufferedReader(istream);
</code>
</p><p>
Similarly, to create an object to read from a file, you would use
code like the following
<code class="code">
java.io.File infile;
java.io.FileReader istream;
infile = new java.io.File(<span class="emphasis"><em>name-of-file</em></span>);
istream = new java.io.FileReader(infile);
eyes = new BufferedReader(istream);
</code>
</p><p>
Note that the names you choose for your objects need not match
the ones that I've chosen.
</p><p>
BufferedReaders provide one basic method: <code class="code">readLine()</code>.
This method reads the next line of input and returns it as a string.
The line read does not linclude the carriage return or line feed that
typically ends lines.  You typically assign the line read to a variable,
as in 
<code class="code"> 
// Declarations
...
String name; 
...
// Commands
...
name = eyes.readLine(); 
</code>
</p><p>
You may, of course, also use the line read as you may use any string,
such as to print it out directly.
<code class="code">
pen.println(eyes.readLine());
</code>
</p><p>
When you're done with input, you should close it, just as you close
output.
</p><p>
<code class="code">
pen.close();
</code>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional">Rewinding Input</h2></div></div></div><p>
One nice part about <code class="code">BufferedReader</code> objects is that they
permit you to &#8220;<span class="quote">back up</span>&#8221; in the input file.  As you will note from
<a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html" target="_top">the documentation</a>, you can use <code class="code">mark</code> to indicate a place
to which you will rewind and <code class="code">reset</code> to rewind to that place.
Note that <code class="code">mark</code>  takes one parameter, <code class="code">readAheadLimit</code>,
a number that indicates the maximum number of characters that will be read
before the next call to <code class="code">reset</code>.  For example, here is some
silly code that reads two lines from a file and then prepares to read the
first of the two lines again.
</p><p>
<code class="code">
eyes.mark(1024);
pen.println(eyes.readLine());
pen.println(eyes.readLine());
eyes.reset();
</code>
