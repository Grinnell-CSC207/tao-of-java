<section id="unit-testing"><title>Unit Testing and JUnit</title>

<para>
  <emphasis>Summary</emphasis>: We consider <quote>unit testing</quote>,
  an approach to software development and to the verification of
  computer programs.  We also introduce JUnit, a unit testing framework
  for Java.
</para>

<section id="unit-testing-intro"><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
  Most computer programmers strive to write clear, efficient, and correct
  code. It is (usually) easy to determine whether code is clear. With some
  practice and knowledge of the correct approaches, one can determine
  how efficient code is (or should be). However, it is often difficult
  to determine whether or not code is correct.
</para>

<para>
  The gold standard of correctness is a formal proof that the
  procedure or program is correct. However, in order to prove a program or
  procedure correct, one must develop a rich mathematical toolkit and devote
  significant effort to writing the proof. Such effort is worth it for
  life-critical applications, but for many programs, it is often more than
  can be reasonably expected.
</para>

<para>
  There is also a disadvantage of formal proof: Code often changes and the
  proof must therefore also change. Why does code change? At times, the
  requirements of the code change (e.g., a procedure that was to do three
  related things is now expected to do four related things). At other times,
  with experience, programmers realize that they can improve the code by
  making a few changes. If we require that all code be proven correct, and
  if changing code means rewriting the proof, then we discourage programmers
  from changing their code.  (Automated proof systems can help with all
  of this, but they are beyond the scope of this course.)
</para>

<para>
  Hence, we need other ways to have some confidence that our code is
  correct. A typical mechanism is a test suite, a collection of tests that
  are unlikely to all succeed if the code being tested is erroneous. One
  nice aspect of a test suite is that when you make changes, you can
  simply re-run the test suite and see if all the tests succeed. To many,
  test suites encourage programmers to experiment with improving their
  code, since good suites will tell them immediately whether or not the
  changes they have made are successful.
</para>

<para>
  What should a test suite look like?  First, it should be as
  <emphasis>comprehensive</emphasis> as possible.  That is, it should poke
  into the nooks and crannies of the code, looking at not only special
  cases, but also a variety of general cases.  Second, it should be
  as <emphasis>automatic</emphasis> as possible.  Evidence suggests
  that programmers are less likely to take the time to test <quote>by
  hand</quote> or to compare actual output to expected output.
  (Computers are also really good at comparing things, so why would you
  ask a human to do so?)  An ideal test suite is easy to run (usually
  just one button), and gives either a quick affirmation that all tests
  passed or a summary of what tests failed.  (Some only tell you the first
  test that failed, which is useful, too.  You shouldn't use code that
  doesn't pass all of its tests.)
</para>

<para>
  Testing is also a core component of many agile software development
  methodologies.  Agile programmers have found that writing tests early
  helps programmers think about what they want their code to achieve and
  having convenient and comprehensive tests gives programmers confidence
  to try new approaches.
</para>

<para>
  Most agile testing starts with a concept called <quote>Unit Testing</quote>.
  In unit testing, you focus on testing the small units of a program -
  individual procedures, objects, and perhaps small sets of cooperating
  objects.  While you will eventually need to test the combination of
  smaller units, making sure that your basic units work correctly is
  an important place to start.
</para>

<para>
  Most tests resemble the things you would do by hand - When I give this
  procedure <emphasis>this input</emphasis>, do I get <emphasis>this 
  output</emphasis>?  You'd probably run experiments like that while
  developing your code, so why not document them as code?  It doesn't
  take long (in most cases, less time than it would to run the program
  and compare answers by hand).  You can also take advantage of the
  computer to run more tests and to automate tests.  For example, if
  you were writing a square root procedure, instead of just checking that
  the square root of 4 is 2 and the square root of 100 is 10, you can
  confirm that the square root of the square of i is i for every i from,
  say, 1 to 100.
</para>

<section id="intro-junit"><title>Unit Testing and JUnit</title>

<para>
  One of the first unit testing frameworks was SUnit, designed for
  the smalltalk language.  It was soon ported to Java, as JUnit.
  It remains one of the most popular unit testing frameworks for Java,
  and so it will be the framework we use in this course.
</para>

<para>
  JUnit provides most of what you want in a testing framework:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    It's easy to run a series of tests once you've specified them.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    It's easy to group test suites into bigger test suites.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    You can test a variety of behaviors, not just <quote>are these
    two things equal</quote>, but also <quote>does this code throw
    an exception</quote> and such.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    You can easily scaffold your tests, setting up some objects and
    such before each test.
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</section> <!-- junit -->

<section id="junit-eclipse"><title>Using JUnit in Eclipse</title>

<para>
  We also use JUnit because it is integrated into Eclipse.
</para>

<para>
  To create a new JUnit test for a class in Eclipse, right click
  the class that we want to test then choose <guimenu>New</guimenu>
  &gt; <guimenuitem>JUnit Test Case</guimenuitem>.  A <quote>New
  JUnit Test Case</quote> window should appear. Once there, click the
  <guibutton>Next</guibutton> button.  You can now select the methods that
  you want to test.  After that, click the <guibutton>Finish</guibutton>
  button.  You now have a test class, typically in the same package as
  your original class.
</para>

<para>
  Within the test class that you just made, there will be methods that are
  prefixed with the word <code>test</code> and the annotation 
  <code>@Test</code>. These are what you will use to test each method
  you have chosen. At the moment they all should have a simple body,
  something like,
</para>

<programlisting>
        fail("Not yet implemented");
</programlisting>

<para>
  We will replace this line with our test or tests.  To start with, we'll
  use the <methodname>assertEquals</methodname> method, which takes three
  parameters: a string that describes the test, the expected value, and
  the expression to test.  For example, if I've written a method called
  <methodname>average</methodname> in the <code>Math</code> class,
  I might do a simple test with
</para>

<programlisting>
        assertEquals("averaging 1 and 3", 2, Calculator.average(1,3));
</programlisting>

<para>
  While <methodname>assertEquals</methodname> will be our primary tools,
  JUnit provides a variety of other kinds of assertion tests.  You
  can read documentation at 
  <ulink url="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Assert.html"/>.
</para>

<para>
  You can put as many assertions in a test as you want, but JUnit
  will only tell you if they all succeeded - the first one that fails
  will trigger an error.
</para>

<para>
  You may also find it useful to split your test into multiple methods.
  As long as you annotate each with <code>@Test</code> (and, in some
  versions of JUnit, make sure the procedure name starts with 
  <code>test</code>), JUnit will run them.  But even if you have multiple
  methods, JUnit will generally still stop with the first one.
</para>

<para>
  For example, suppose we want to test this class.
</para>

<programlisting>
<xi:include href="../examples/taojava/examples/junit/MyMath.java" parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
/></programlisting>

<para>
  A preliminary set of tests might look something like the following.
</para>

<programlisting>
<xi:include href="../examples/taojava/examples/junit/MyMathTest.java" parse="text" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
/></programlisting>

<para>
  As you may have noted, in order to use the static procedures from
  <code>MyMath</code>, we have to precede them with the class name.
  Java expects you to be very careful on naming the methods you use.
</para>

<para>
  Note that all of the tests <emphasis>must</emphasis> be preceded by
  <code>@Test</code>.  If you remove that text, JUNit will no longer
  run it.  (Try it and see.)
</para>

<para>
  JUnit may not run the tests in the order you expect.  So 
  make sure not to rely on values you set up in one test in another test.
  For example, if you are working on lists and add an element to the list
  in <methodname>testA</methodname>, you may not find that the element
  is there in <methodname>testB</methodname>.  Similarly, at first 
  glance it might seem that these two tests could not both succeed:
</para>

<programlisting>
    int x = 3;

    @Test
    public void testOne() {
      assertEquals(3, x);
      x += 1;
      assertEquals(4, x);
    } // testOne
   
    @Test
    public void testTwo() {
      assertEquals(3, x);
      x += 1;
      assertEquals(4, x);
    } // testTwo
</programlisting>

<para>
  However, JUnit essentially resets the environment between every 
  tests.  And that's a good thing.  You should be able to write tests
  that are not affected by what happens in other tests.  (Yes, that's
  probably another form of encapsulation.)
</para>

<para>
  So, what should we do if we want to do the same setup for all of
  our tests, setup that requires additional code.  One possibility
  is to create a method and then just call it from each test.  But
  JUnit provides another option.  In particular, JUnit provides the
  <code>@Before</code> annotation which you can add to any procedure
  you want called before every test.  Traditionally, that procedure is
  called <methodname>setUp</methodname>, and you should probably use
  that name for clarity.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis>Warning!  On occasion, Eclipse seems to forget about the
  <code>@Before</code> annotation.  In those cases, creating a new JUnit
  Test Case and clicking the box to include <methodname>setUp</methodname>
  usually works.</emphasis>
